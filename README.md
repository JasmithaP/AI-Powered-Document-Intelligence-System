# AI-Powered-Document-Intelligence-System
A GenAI-powered tool that extracts structured insights and answers questions from unstructured documents using GPT-4, LangChain, and FAISS.

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze documents such as PDFs, reports, and emails, extracting actionable insights like names, dates, topics, and key takeaways. It supports natural language question-answering and summarization through a simple web interface.

Built with:

LangChain for document processing and prompt orchestration

OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating intelligent responses

FAISS for fast and efficient vector search

Streamlit for the user-friendly front end

🎯 Key Features
📄 Document Upload & Parsing: Upload PDF documents for automatic text extraction and processing

🧠 Contextual QA: Ask natural language questions and receive LLM-generated answers based on document content

🔍 Semantic Search: Uses vector embeddings to retrieve the most relevant context from the document

✨ Entity & Insight Extraction: Automatically identifies and highlights key elements like names, dates, and action items

⚡ Fast Performance: Uses FAISS to ensure low-latency semantic retrieval from large document sets

💡 Use Cases
Legal or policy document summarization

Meeting minutes or report digest generation

Automated document review for analysts

Business intelligence from internal reports or communications

## How to Run
